# Link
A sample implementation of the program Link for Windows.

For details, please, see the publication:

Tomasz E. Koralewski, John K. Westbrook, William E. Grant, Hsiao-Hsuan Wang  "Coupling general physical environmental process models with specific question-driven ecological simulation models"

Please, note:
- The script Link should be executed before simulation model is run.
- Some files are deleted and/or renamed during the code execution, which potentially may lead to unintended data loss if not properly backed up.
